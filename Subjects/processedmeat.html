      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Processed Meat was created by mixing various foods, starting with a base of turkey, and incorporating any food found during lunch time. Most processing occured during B-Day lunch periods, however some documented incidents involving Processed Meat happened during A-Day lunches.
        <br>
        Its origins can be traced back to <a href="">Sam McLaney</a> as he would crush up bags of chips and "fool" people by giving it to them for free without the victim knowing that the chips were crushed.
        After this, finomon began using the turkey from school lunches and turn it into Processed Meat by kneading it inside of a plastic bag. The Processed Meat industry then began to grow as more people began to chip
        in and put their own food into the bag. The first instance of Processed Meat was a combination of the crushed chips and the processed turkey meat. Over time, it began to increase in ingredients. Experiments were conducted to measure the correct amount of 
        Worse combinations after worse combinations were discovered as everyone from the B-Day lunch table started experimenting with different kinds of food.
        <br>
        Some foods experimented with include:
        <ul>
          <li>Yogurt</li>
          <li>Broccoli</li>
          <li>Cheese</li>
          <li>Chips</li>
          <li>Ground beef</li>
          <li>Candy</li>
          <li>Bread</li>
          <li>Strawberries</li>
          <li>Canned tuna</li>
        </ul>
        Eventually, the industry of processed meat began to degrade significantly. Pure saliva began being placed into the meat as a substitute to fresh ingredients.
        This new "modern version" of processed meat had a stink that spread a significant portion of the cafeteria, and so production moved to the <a href="">Balcony</a> to remove this factor.
        <br>
        However, as the meat declined in quality, so did the industry. After Incident ProcessedMeat-1A, production of processed meat declined until it finally ended.
      </p>
      <h2>Incident ProcessedMeat-1A</h2>
      <p>
        During the twilight days of the Processed Meat era, a security guard told finomon to eat the processed meat or throw it away. Instead of eating it, finomon decided to throw it away, however he later fished it out of the trash can again just to continue processing it.
        This incident directly led to the making of processed meat to become more secretive and eventually the practice completely died down. By the end of 8th Grade, processed meat had completely vanished from A-Day and even B-Day lunches, and the industry was completely
        abolished.
