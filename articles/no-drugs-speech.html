  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p1><br>The "Say No to Drugs" speech was a incident that happened around the same time that <b>The Curse of Geometry</b> was happening. It began during <b> 5th period </b> where both <b>Wolfgang </b> and <b>Evan G </b> reported to the bleachers in the gym. A guest speaker then began presenting a canva talking about how drugs affect the mind. During the majority of the speech they where both trying not to laugh do to the effects of The Curse Of Geomtery. This was facilitated by the multitude of corrupt quotes that the speaker was talking about which activated the Curse.</p1>
