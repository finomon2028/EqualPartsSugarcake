        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>
            During class, Evan G discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Huffman"> Todd Huffman's wikipedia page </a>using Ctrl+X (takes user to a random page). He proceeded to download the image shown above, and then slowly corrupted it in MS paint. The file was saved as "War_Rugs_from_Afghanistan.jpg", however the original corrupted file has since been lost.
